# üìâ Gap Down Recovery Strategy - NIFTY 500 Stocks

A Python-based backtesting framework that implements the **Gap Down Recovery** strategy on **NIFTY 500** stocks using historical data from Yahoo Finance. This project helps analyze the effectiveness of a simple price-action-based trading strategy with fixed parameters.

## üìå Strategy Overview

The **Gap Down Recovery Strategy** is a momentum-based trading technique that:

1. **Detects a gap down** in a stock ‚Äî when the stock opens significantly lower than the previous day‚Äôs closing price.
2. **Waits for a recovery** of a specific percentage.
3. **Enters a trade** on confirmation of recovery.
4. **Exits** based on a target profit, stop loss, or after a maximum holding period.
